        The chinchilla is a small, South American rodent that is known for its soft, luxurious fur. Chinchillas are native to the Andes Mountains in Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, where they live in burrows or crevices in rocks. They are crepuscular animals, which means they are most active during dawn and dusk.
